This repository serves as a collection of core projects, analyses, and code related to the Data Science subject. It includes implementations of various machine learning models, data visualization examples, and foundational statistical analyses.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories to keep different types of content easily accessible:

* **`data/`**: Stores datasets used for analysis (small files, or a placeholder for instructions on where to download larger files).
* **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) where exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and visualization are performed.
