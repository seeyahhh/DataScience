This repository serves as a collection of core projects, analyses, and code related to the Data Science subject. It includes implementations of various machine learning models, data visualization examples, and foundational statistical analyses.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories to keep different types of content easily accessible:

* **`data/`**: Stores datasets used for analysis (small files, or a placeholder for instructions on where to download larger files).
* **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) where exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and visualization are performed.

## Key Project Areas

### 1. Data Visualization (`/notebooks/viz/`)

This section focuses on using libraries like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** to create informative and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.

* **Goals:**
    * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots).
    * Time-series plots and geospatial data representation.
    * Interactive dashboards (if applicable).

### 2. Regression Analysis (`/notebooks/regression/`)

Implementations and case studies involving various regression techniques, primarily using **scikit-learn** and **statsmodels**.

* **Examples:**
    * **Linear Regression:** Basic implementation and assumptions check.
    * **Ridge/Lasso Regression:** Regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
    * **Logistic Regression:** Classification using a linear model.

### 3. Machine Learning Models (`/notebooks/models/`)

This folder contains notebooks dedicated to training and evaluating different supervised and unsupervised machine learning models.

* **Supervised Learning:**
    * Decision Trees and Random Forests.
    * Support Vector Machines (SVM).
    * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
* **Unsupervised Learning:**
    * K-Means Clustering.
    * Dimensionality Reduction (PCA).
